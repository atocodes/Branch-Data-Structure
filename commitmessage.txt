loop_through method change and id for every node

search()
it used to be sub method called loop_through() in order to find 
and return the parent node for the next child node but now i made a
search algorythm to search and return the parent node so now its
possible to create a child for the specific parent.

ID 
now every parent and childern node have a specific id.
the main use abt the id is there a much possibility that there will 
be same datas in the branch and in order to reduce the possibility of
unwanted mis getting the parent node i have provided an id for 
every nodes.

CONCLUSION
now so it is possible to search by id or by the name of the data.
best recomanded is to search by ID.

FINALLY
i belive the data structure so far is working as expected to be 
emplimented on the web app project i am currently working on called 
BRANCH it has a couple of methods and configurations the needed to be
done. so far its a big step
