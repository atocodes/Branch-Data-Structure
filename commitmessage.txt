loop_through method change and id for every node

search()
it used to be sub method called loop_through() in order to find 
and return the parent node for the next child node but now i made a
search algorythm to search and return the parent node so now its
possible to create a child for the specific parent.

ID 
now every parent and childern node have a specific id.
the main use abt the id is there a much possibility that there will 
be same datas in the branch and in order to reduce the possibility of
unwanted mis getting the parent node i have provided an id for 
every nodes.

CONCLUSION
now so it is possible to search by id or by the name of the data.
best recomanded is to search by ID.

FINALLY
i belive the data structure so far is working as expected to be 
emplimented on the web app project i am currently working on called 
BRANCH it has a couple of methods and configurations the needed to be
done. so far its a big step

searchMany, remove, size, delete_head and sort new methods and id data type changes on parent nodes(branches).

searchMany()
searchMany: method is now available to search duplicated datas in the branch 
and returns an array of mathcing datas.
One of the features about searchMany() method is that if we want to get all 
branch data is now possible by giving the data "*" which by means is all so
the function will return an array of all branches.

remove()
remove: method takes an id as argument in order to remove the expected data in the branch
id is chosen because of not to create unwanted results.
***it removes with its sub branches (child_nodes)***
so be alert about that.

size()
size: method returns an intiger of the size in the branch data counting all the
datas in the branch.

delete_head
delete_head: method will remove the head of the data structure.

sort()
sort: method sorts all the nodes(branches) by their id's.
